# Database Integration and Models

## Hi Guys im Ajinkya working on this project as a backend developer.


So, I have created a demo app to just check the models and CRUD operations, DB integration of the app.

I have created a simple data and domains folder in which i will write all the data and domain logic.
If you guys wanna inetegrated it jsut copy past the folders into your app and add dependencies.

## Setup

After cloning or copying the files, you must run the build runner to generate the database code:

```bash
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```
